# Simulation-of-CPU-scheduling-algorithms
C++ and Java applications to simulate 4 CPU scheduling algorithms: 1) FCFS (First Come First Served) based pre-emptive Priority. 2) Round Robin Scheduling with Priority. 3) Three-level Queue Scheduling. 4) Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN) Scheduling with Priority.
